        <div class="container">
            <p>Our ‘Fix’ activities fall into three themes; Dr Bike, Learn-to-Fix and ‘Pre-Cycled’:</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Dr Bike</b> : these are pop-up workshops, usually in a Town Centre, where people can bring their bikes to be fixed. Typical on-the-spot repairs include punctures, brake adjustment and replacement, bearing adjustment, lubrication, frame and fork adjustment, wheel truing and basic M-Checks. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Learn-to-Fix</b> : delivered by trained and qualified Bicycle Mechanics, these workshops enable participants to learn skill in bicycle maintenance and covers Health & Safety (e.g. RIDDOR, LOLER, COSHH and PUWER), braking principles, gear indexing, wheels truing and tyres as well as framesets, bearings, hubs and tubes. Our Learn-to-Fix workshops typically take place in Community Centres, Schools and Churches.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Pre-Cycled</b> : taking cycles donated to us, we repair and renovate and donate these bikes to other causes around Torbay where residents need a bike. In some cases, a Pre-Cycled bike makes a huge difference to someone who is on a limited budget or low income, meaning that they are able to travel around Torbay and access work, training, services, activities and other opportunities.

        <div class="container">
        <p>Using trained Ride Leaders, our Social Bike Rides are informal group rides where participants can cycle at their own pace. A Social Bike Ride can be anywhere from 500 metre to 20m miles. The Social Bike Rides begin at a prearranged starting point and end at a café or venue where participants can chat. </p>

        </header>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <p>As participants build confidence in cycling, they are more likely to use cycling as a form of active travel which helps reduce health risks both physically and mentally, as well as use a more affordable form of transport. The other benefit, is that cycling has a positive impact on the environment – as a bicycle has zero emissions, it means there are no toxic gases produced into the atmosphere! This is another key outcome for us at Cycle Torbay CIC. </p>

<h4>*For Bicycle Donations</h4><p>Please use the ‘Contact Us’ page – we will be able to arrange a convenient drop-off point. In some cases, we can collect bicycle donations, but there is usually a charge for this service. Please also be aware, that we are unable to take bikes that have been stored outdoors for some time – often in this case, the damage caused by outside elements renders the bike uneconomical to repair. </p>
